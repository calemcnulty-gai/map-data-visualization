## Development Timeline

```
Week 1-2:   Phase 1 - Setup
Week 3-6:   Phase 2 - MVP
Week 7-10:  Phase 3 - Enhancement  
Week 11-13: Phase 4 - Polish
```

Total estimated duration: **13 weeks** (3 months)

## Key Milestones

1. **Authentication Working** (End of Phase 1)
   - Staff can log in with Google accounts
   - Domain restrictions enforced

2. **First Visualization** (Mid Phase 2)
   - Generate PNG for a single student
   - Basic calculations working

3. **MVP Complete** (End of Phase 2)
   - Full single-student workflow
   - Production-quality visualizations

4. **Batch Processing** (Mid Phase 3)
   - Handle multiple students efficiently
   - Customization options available

5. **Production Ready** (End of Phase 4)
   - Deployed on EC2
   - Monitoring in place
   - Full documentation

---

## Technical Progression

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
- From static landing page to dynamic dashboard
- From mock data to real Google Sheets integration
- From authentication only to full user workflows

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
- From single student to batch processing
- From fixed templates to customization
- From basic charts to advanced visualizations

### Phase 3 → Phase 4
- From functional to polished UI
- From development to production infrastructure
- From minimal to comprehensive monitoring

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Google Sheets API limits**: Implement caching early (Phase 2)
- **Performance at scale**: Design for batching from Phase 2
- **Browser compatibility**: Test early and often

### Timeline Risks
- **Calculation complexity**: Validate formulas in Phase 2
- **UI polish time**: Start refinements in Phase 3
- **Deployment complexity**: Begin infrastructure setup in Phase 3
